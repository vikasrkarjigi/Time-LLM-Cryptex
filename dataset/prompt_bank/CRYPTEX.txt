The Binance Bitcoin Hourly Returns (BTC-H) dataset captures granular financial data from the Binance.us cryptocurrency exchange. It spans nearly four months, from July 2024 to December 2024, with hourly-level resolution. Each record contains updates for returns of hourly closing prices and traded volume in USD. Timestamps are stored in Unix time format. Inactive periods (with no trading activity) are represented with NaN values, while missing timestamps may reflect exchange/API downtime or data collection limitations. The dataset has been carefully deduplicated and validated, and is updated nightly to ensure consistency and completeness.
